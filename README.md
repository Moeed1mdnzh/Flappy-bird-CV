# Flappy-bird-CV
Are you TIRED of playing flappy bird and losing each time? Well i've made a solution for that. Let's now use a single red pen to keep your bird alive.
# About
This project is meant to make flappy bird easier.You should use a red pen infront of the webcam to control the bird. Make sure that you don't have any red objects infront of the webcam except the red pen.After clicking on the start button you should be able to see the frames that your webcam is capturing and if it was flipped you can simply go to the pen.py file and remove the line 26 (self.img = self.flip(self.img)) from your current file.There is also an example file and you better watch it to understand the whole process.
# IMPORTANT
This project might have some timing bugs so please ignore them and i couldn't solve them.For example sometimes you get more than 1 point when you pass a single pipe.
